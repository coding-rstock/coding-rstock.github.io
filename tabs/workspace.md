### Questions for Instructors
---
***Website***
- How to best manage/organize posts (markdown files) for SSG websites in the git repo?  Currently they are all just sitting in the `_posts` folder.
- I'm unable to get Github's "workflow" feature to trigger automatically when I push from local to remote, and therefore have to run `bash tools/publish.sh` inside my local git repo, to manually re-build the site from the terminal every time I push.
