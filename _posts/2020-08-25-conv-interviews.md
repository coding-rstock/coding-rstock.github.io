**Interview Process**

- Recruiters / head hunters that don’t work for the organization that is hiring will first reach out to you to assess your fit / motivations for the job.
- If you are someone they want to represent you to the hiring organization, you will enter the interview process with the company.
- The head hunter will ask on front end what you expect for salary:  An approach is to discolse exactly what one is currently making, but he doesn’t do that any more.  He assesses the job in terms of what he will get out of the job (if he will gain huge benefit from learning new skills or working with exceptional team, can sacrifice a bit on pay, and vice versa - if not beneficial, ask for more salary.)

**Technical Test**

- 1 hour call with engineer - hackerink - a window that the engineer can see you coding in real time.  
- Three phases of problem solving.  He spent a lot of time over communicating because they are assessing your ability to talk and communicate about your problem solving 
- You choose the language you want to solve the problem with.  Unless the company is like “we do Ruby”.
- They are also assessing how you deal with a real challenge - do you shut down, do you panic, do you go inward (silent), etc.  They are assessing your security or insecurities.  He explained the rationale behind the problem.

	1. Take Home test - initial filter
	2. Then interview with hiring manager - do you have the soft skils.   Behavioral tests - talk about a time with conflict.  A time where you needed to persuade co-workers.  

JP:  People should interview at least once a year.
