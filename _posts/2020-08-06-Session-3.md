- Man pages - each section is written towards a different audience.  
- Options - you can combine multiple (ex: instead of “ls -a -h -l”, “ls -ahl”)
- Git Hub is the most common git repo, but Git Lab is a more integrated, all in one service from start to finish of a development project’s life cycle.
- Create an account at GitLab
- SSH keys uploaded (next session)
- SSH is used to copy git directories to other servers.
- Can be easier to use HTTPS transfer protocol to start, but SSH is better.
- Mo demo’d how to push and pull a project from my local machine to Git Lab using the documentation that is provided on the GitLab website.
- Assigned a reading assignment for today: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/#gitlab-basics>
