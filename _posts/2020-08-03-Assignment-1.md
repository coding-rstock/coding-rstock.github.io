This week we're going to start working with a version control tool called "git".

The book that we're going to work through is the git-scm book. It's available at: Pro Git - Book

Goals for this week:

- Install git
- Initialize an empty git repository
- Staging changes
- Commit changes
- Writing good commit messages:  [Semantic Commit Messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)

Next week, we'll work towards setting up a website hosted on [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)

As I mentioned last week, I would like you to think about a read, write, execute (rwx) goal for each day.

We won't have a working engineering journal for a couple of weeks. So I would like you to send me an email with the content of your `write` goal.

To get you going, I'm going to propose the following `rwx` goal for tomorrow:

* Read: [Section 1.1: Getting Started](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) of the git book
* Write: What is version control?
* Execute: Install git

Please let me know if you have any questions.
