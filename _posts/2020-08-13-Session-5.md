- Question:  I couldn’t get Vim to accept my git commit message when pressing return, so i had to use :q and then it failed to commit due to empty commit message, and then i used “-m” and manually did it.
- Terminal shortcuts for git (ex “lga”) - are they configured in your gitconfig file?
- I might have missed this, but when you merged your branch with the upstream and it kept the original story with the 2nd line you had written, was that a default git behavior, or did you manually have to specify you wanted to keep it?
- NEED TO REWATCH THIS, there was a lot going on at a high speed.
- Ssh agent - use this to avoid having to type in ssh passphrase every time
