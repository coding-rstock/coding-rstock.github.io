Well, one more email today, I didn’t end up getting the wiki up yet as I had a few things come up today with family, we are still in Red Deer.

Thanks for the info on Markdown, I’ve been enjoying using it, and downloaded a pretty cool Markdown editor for Mac called “Typora” which I’m using for creating my Wiki pages.

I hope to get a couple of them pushed up to GitLab tomorrow!

Have a good night.
