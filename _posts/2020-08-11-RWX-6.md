***Read***:  watched:  Mo’s Aug 11 session on “Git-book” assignment

***Write***:  None.

***Execute***:

- Created my GitLab account `@richard_stock`
- I had to install Git on my MacBook Pro as I don’t have my Linux PC in Red Deer.  Installed Homebrew from the command line using `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)` and then used `brew install git`, and then `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH` to set the path to the local git distro instead of the Apple one.  Used `git --version` to ensure the  latest version of Git was installed (2.28.0).
- Created an SSH key using the terminal command:  `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "rstock.co@gmail.com"`
- Added SSH key to GitLab, using  `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to copy SSH key to clipboard, and then pasting into GitLab’s interface.
- Created my own fork of the `git-book` project using GitLab.
- Cloned the forked GitLab repo to my local computer.
- Created a feature branch using command `git branch chapter-1`
