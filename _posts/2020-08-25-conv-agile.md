**SCRUM**

SCRUM - 1) sprint 1-2 weeks to design/build/test and ship to customers.  Forces you to prioritize on what features are important - adjusts you development so that it is flexible enough to embrace change (as you can’t design a full featured app in 2 weeks).  
Initial build is the smallest cost of a project - maintenance and adding features is the bigger cost.  Therefore you want to build something that can scale, accept new features, change over time.  Software construction and design principles are invaluable to learn and apply to the initial build, as it is the foundation.  Comparable to building a house that you will eventually need to build an addition on for bigger family.    

Scrum Books:

Agile book - Craig Lardon - Manager’s Guide to Agile / Iterative Development
User Stories Applied - Cohen 
XP Explained - Kent Beck

These 3 books form the foundation for Mo’s Agile / iterative thinking.  Anti patterns.
