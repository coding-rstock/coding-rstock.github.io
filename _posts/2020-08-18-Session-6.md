Note: I screenshared and asked questions for most of this session so wasn't able to take notes except one part on SSH:

- Public key encrypts something, Private key decrypts public key.
- Encryption is to ensure no one can read message, and we know the sender is who they say they are.
- Can share public key with the person you want to send messages to.  
- Someone can obtain your public key and “spoof” - pretend to be the other person.  Digital signatures prevent spoofing by 
- SSH Agent to avoid having to enter SSH passphrase each time
