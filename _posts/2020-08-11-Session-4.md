- Git Book - copy of the repository hosted on GitLab.
- I have to create a gitlab account and let Mo know the handle.
- Git lab allows a fork, 
- Correct errors, make edits
- I will be the reviewer, i will approve the merge request.
- Research - i will submit a merge request
- Ask Mo questions on GitLab
- Forking isn’t technically a Git term.  Pull/merge/change requests is also a GitLab/Hub feature.  
- The Git history is separate from the GitLab history - the comments between devs, etc is solely in GitLab.
- Roles - maintainers.  Process of making me a maintainer.  
- You have to have “commit bit” - to have authorization to approve merge requests.
