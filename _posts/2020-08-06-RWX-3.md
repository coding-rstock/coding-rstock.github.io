***Read***:  [GitLab Basics Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/#gitlab-basics) - multiple sections

***Write***:

*Authentication (SSH Keys & 2FA)*
- It’s best practice to use Git over SSH instead of HTTP.
- To use SSH you need to create a key pair in your terminal: `(ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<comment>"` [comment is typically your email address]), accept the suggested file and directory, set up a passphrase for your SSH key, and then add the public key to your GitLab account (to add key using Linux, you’ll need the xclip package, and use: `xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to copy your public SSH key to the clipboard.  Then you’ll navigate to gitlab.com and sign in, select your avatar and click "Settings --> SSH keys", paste in your public key into the Key textbox, include a descriptive name in the Title, optionally include an expiry date for the key, and click “Add Key”).
- ED25519 SSH keys are more secure and perform better than RSA ones (If you use RSA you should use at least 2048 bits key size instead of default 1024 bits).
- You can update your passphrase at any time with `ssh-keygen -p -f /path/to/ssh_key`
- You can test that it was set up properly by using `ssh -T <your GitLab’s instance domain>`.  
- The first time you connect to GitLab via SSH, you will need to verify `yes` when prompted `are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?`  This happens only once, and each time after you’ll get a welcome message.
- You can enable 2FA to your GitLab account for more security.  After you do, you’ll be prompted to download a list of recovery codes, which you should print or store in safe place.  You can’t use your normal account password if 2FA is enabled, you must use a personal access token instead.

*Creating Projects, Groups, & Branches in GitLab*
- Most work in GitLab is done in projects which include files and code.
- To create a project you can use a template (built in or custom), import one from a different repo, or create a blank one.  GitLab is developing Enterprise templates to help meet audits/regulatory standards.  
- You can also push a local repo to create a project on GitLab: `git push --set-upstream git@gitlab.example.com:namespace/nonexistent-project.git master`
- Groups allow you to manage and collaborate across multiple projects.  Members of a group have access to all of it’s projects.  You can create nested subgroups.  Existing projects can be moved into a group.  
- When adding users to a group, you can set their permission level.  You can remove members and change the owner of the group.  You can view a group’s activity.  You can share a group with another group.  You can transfer subgroups to new parent groups, and convert parents to subgroups.  You can lock a group to prevent new memberships (as owner).  You can set group push rules.  You can view analytics on group member’s contributions.
- A branch is an independent line of development in a project.  When you create a new branch in your terminal, you are creating a snapshot of a certain branch, usually the main master branch at its current state.  From there you can start to make your own changes without affecting the main codebase.  All your changes will be tracked in your branch.  When your changes are ready, you merge them using a merge request.

***Execute***:

- Did some configuration of Ubuntu.
- Set up “coding” Internet bookmarks in my web browser (Chromium) with nested subfolders, as I’m starting to feel there is a lot of information to start organizing into an efficient framework / reference system for future use.  Similar to creating a mind map of all the concepts we are touching on so far, and ones I know I will need to learn.
- Started to set up YouTube playlists on various topics, and watched a few videos on using the Linux Terminal.

> You are flying through this. Organizing this flood of information is going to be helpful. I maintain a wiki using vimwiki to keep track of rough notes and thoughts. I sync my vimwiki notes using keybase so that I can view/edit my notes from different devices.
> 
> If you're starting the journey with vim then you may also like the vimwiki plugin. I have heard that "org" mode in emacs is amazing but I have no experience with that.
> 
> This week has been a lot of fun for me. I am glad to hear that the pace is working for you too. I am impressed with your consistency and thankful that you trust me enough to provide you with a bit of guidance.
> 
> Next week I would like to go over branching in git and then start to introduce you to a language called markdown. I have an idea for a game that we can play to learn about collaborating through git. Until then please enjoy this video:
