### Main Topic

Arrays & Loops

### Review 

- We write code, it gets compiled into machine language, which can be run in an executable file.
- Datatypes:  numbers (int, float), characters (char), arrays (deck of cards)

### Today’s lesson

- Most programming languages use zero based indexes for arrays, so they start as 0 instead of 1.
- Example of 4 bikes in a bike rack
- Question:  why did you have to write the variable “bike” in the “new line” /n ‘printf’ command?
- Loops: `[18:00]:  comparative to washing clothes every week.  There are steps you have to do with washing clothes → collect dirty clothes, separate whites from colors, load colors, add soap, close door/lid, start machine, dry colors, load whites, add soap, close door/lid, start machine, dry whites
- There are 2 high level types of loops.  1) for loop,  2) while loop.  
- Examples of using a For loop to fill an array.
