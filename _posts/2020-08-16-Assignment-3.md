This week I think it would be beneficial to start chatting about HTML. I don't have a good book recommendation for this which is perfect because I think finishing Pragmatic Thinking and Learning is important. The next book will be "The Pragmatic Programmer".

Also, as part of the "execute" step for each day this week I would like you to get in to the practice of submitting a new merge request on a daily basis. For now, I would love for you to add a new passage to the `git-book` project.

The practice of pull from the the upstream remote, cutting a new branch, pushing the branch to your remote then opening a new Merge request will be good for you. You'll end up doing this almost daily when you start to work on a team. So making this second nature will be useful. You'll also get some practice with dealing with merge conflicts because your teammates (me) might
accidentally introduce some.

So to re-iterate for this week I would like you to practice the following:

* Staging changes
* [Writing good log messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)
* Committing
* Switching between branches
* Pushing to remote repositories
* Research branch naming conventions for "feature based" development
* Leveraging Semantic Commit Messages for effective "log reading"

If you find it helpful, I can open up issues in the project issue tracker to keep you focused. Or if you prefer to get some practice with opening issues, please let me know.

Next week, staring Monday, August. 31, I will be on holidays. Don't worry, I'll chat with you later this week to make sure that we keep you on track and that you have enough material to keep you busy.

In the up coming weeks, I would like to start to get you familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Here's a brief overview to get you thinking:

1. HTML: The content.
2. CSS: The presentation.
3. JavaScript: The behaviour.

On Tuesday, let's take a look at the issue you were having with ruby and the gem to synchronize the wiki. I want to make sure that you have a working environment that you're comfortable in. This means that I am going to ask you to screenshare and act as the driver. I'll help navigate.

Last but not least, there's a few questions that I've jotted down that's come up in discussion. E.g. the different roles on a team, dotfiles configuration etc. I'm not sure what the best way to go over these items but I'm thinking about recording an "Errata" episode each week. I'm not sure if this would be helpful or distracting for you. Let me know what you think.

I think that's all for now.

Happy hacking!

> Hey Mo,
>
> Thanks for letting me know about those git commands (`reflog/gc`), I haven't read about them yet.  Yeah i did learn from the experience and clearly I need to practice a lot more to be comfortable with navigating branches and merges from the terminal.   Looking forward to practicing more git this week.
> 
> Sounds great about learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript!   I'll keep on reading the Pragmatic books.
> 
> I'll be submitting a merge request tonight on the book, and I can open up an issue regarding the git practice steps this week.
> 
> Glad you are taking a break! I'm sure it's been busy with work and school on the weekends, plus helping me learn.  I really appreciate all the effort you have been making with this!  
> 
> Yeah that sounds good for tomorrow's session, I can take the lead, and it will fit in good with what I did today - I got a bit down a rabbit trail for a few hours with something I wanted to set up real quick and it involved ruby again.  I was just trying to set up a better place to keep a record of my assignments than this email chain (just for my reference), so I tried to set up a private Jekyll website with Github (as I saw Jekyll has automatic integration with Github so i thought i could do it very quick and get back to my real work), but it was taking me a long time to figure out why ruby was having issues installing Jekyll.  I ended up installing `rbenv` ruby version manager and learning about editing my `.bash-profile` file which helped sort things out.   It was actually fun trying to figure it out but the time flew by quicker than I anticipated.
> 
> I really like the idea of an errata episode - that would be very helpful.  If that is a lot of work, even if there was a way to start an Errata FAQ somewhere on a webpage (maybe on the one i'll be building).  We can discuss more.
