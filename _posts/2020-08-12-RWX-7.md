Hi Mo,

This should be my last email, as I've successfully been able to set up a GitLab wiki, clone it to my local, and use VS Code to edit the "home.md" using markdown and push it back to the remote GitLab (formatted properly).   So tomorrow, I plan to build out my wiki a lot more!  below is today's rwx:

***Read***:  
1. [The Markdown Guide](https://usermanual.wiki/Document/markdownguide.1810805552/view) (e-book by Mark Cone)], 
2. [Markdown Syntax Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (by John Gruber), 
3. The entire [GitLab wiki documentation page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/wiki/). 

***Write***:

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language to convert text to HTML for web writers, allowing you to write using an easy to read, easy to write plain text format - and Markdown automatically converts it into valid HTML for you.
- Created in 2004 by John Gruber, is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  
- With MS Word you click buttons and changes are viewed immediately.  Markdown doesn’t do that.  It is meant to be readable WHILE ALSO including subtle formatting syntax for quick and easy formatting (ie. # for header, ** for bold).  You need a Markdown application to process the Markdown file.  These apps use a Markdown processor to output the Markdown file in HTML.  At that point your document can be viewed in a web browser.
- Common uses for Markdown:  take notes, create content for website, produce print ready documents, email messages, grocery lists, etc.
- Resources:
    - General: [A collection of awesome markdown goodies](https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown)
    - Practice Online: [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) is a very good online Markdown editor where you can see your formatting displayed in real time in a pane as you write in Markdown in a different pane.  This is where you want to start as a newbie experimenting with the language.
    - Websites:  For the simplest possible way to create a website with Markdown files, use [blot.im](https://blot.im/) and [smallvictori.es](https://www.smallvictori.es/).  If you’re familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a popular static site generator that takes Markdown files and builds an HTML website. To use a content management system (CMS) to power your website, take a look at [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). It’s a free and open-source blogging platform with a nice Markdown editor.
    - Documents: (Mac): iA Writer, Ulysses, Marked, or MacDown. 
    - Notes:  [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform.
    - Email: [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com/) is a free and open-source browser extension that converts Markdown-formatted text into HTML that’s ready to send.
- Basic Syntax
    - Headings:  The number of `#`’s defines the heading level.
    - Paragraphs:  Use a blank line to separate blocks of text into paras.
    - Line Breaks: End a line with 2 or more spaces, and type return.
    - Bold: Add `**` before and after the text to be bolded.
    - Italic: Same as bold, just add `*`.
    - Bold + Italic: Add `***`.
    - Blockquote (indented paragraph):  Add a `>` in front of a para.  For multiple paras, add a “>” on the blank lines between the paras.  For nested blockquotes, use `>>`.  Note block quotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements.
    - Lists: Ordered:  add line items with numbers followed by periods.  To nest items in an ordered list, indent items by one tab.  Unordered: add dashes or asterisks in front of line items.  To nest, use one tab.
    - Code: Code blocks are normally indented by `one tab`.  If in list, use `2 tabs`.  To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it with tick marks `‘`.  Use double tick marks to escape if the word you want to denote as code includes one or more tick marks.
    - Images: `![image name](image URL “Image Title”)`
    - Horizontal Rules (Lines):  Use 3 or more asterisks/dashes on a line by themselves.
    - Links: `[Link name](Link URL “Title for when user hovers over link”)` Ex: `[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "My search engine!")`.  To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it with angle brackets `<>` To bold link, add `**` before and after.  To italicise, add `*`.
    - Literal Characters:  use `\` to escape from using a character for formatting (ex:  `\*`  - if you want to asterisk something without making it into a list item).
- Extended Syntax
    - Not all Markdown apps support extended syntax, so you’ll need to check.
    - Tables 
    - Footnotes
    - Definitions
    - Strikethrough
    - Fenced Code Blocks
    - Heading ID’s
    - Task lists
    - Auto URL linking (without using brackets)

***Execute***:

- Created a wiki on GitLab called “Richards Wiki”, and then created the “home” page using the GitLab interface.
- Watched: How to Edit a GitLab wiki using local Git environment
    - Installed Ruby (`brew install ruby`)
    - Installed Gollum (never ended up using it as it made my terminal freeze when i ran it).  Installed several packages (based on error messages while trying to compile gollum).
    - Was able to clone the wiki to my local machine, and open the "home.md" file in VS Code, edit it using markdown, and then add/commit/push it back to GitHub.

> :tears: I will miss your emails... but I am excited to read your wiki. Congratulations!
>
> I love Markdown. It use it in so many places. As a developer, it's important to get comfortable working with Markdown. It is a great way to communicate with colleagues, put together high level designs and for taking notes.
>
>The Markdown spec is small. You've already documented most of it in this email. The extensions are nice but I only use a couple of them. i.e tables and code blocks
>
> You'll even find that a lot of textarea elements on a lot of websites also support the Markdown syntax.
>
> The next time you're entering free form text in a textarea element on a web site look to see if it supports Markdown. You just might be surprised!
>
> Happy hacking!
