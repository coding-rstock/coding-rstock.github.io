Abstraction is a huge skill / principle to develop, the ability to identify patterns and structures within a real life problem, so I can map the correct historical solution to it instead of using my previous anecdotal experiences.  Most problems I will come across have already been solved, I just need to identify the problem.  

Do Supplemental reading on identifying design patterns - and how to apply an existing solution to my unique problem.

We are building fundamental problem solving skills.   

**Example: Designing a Product Listing for an Online Store (Shopify, etc)** 

Mapping:  f at x = y  --> This is the core abstraction.  Taking an input and getting an output.  

Now take this simple abstraction and apply it to the problem space of generating product listings.  Stream of products coming in - create product listings of products that share the same set of attributes.  High level abstraction of getting the attributes of a product is “mapping”, matching the same elements and grouping them.  

Abstract Mathematical concepts.  Algebra, pure functions, etc.  Can use pure theory to make sure our code is mathematically and fundamentally structured properly.  

Always thinking of high level abstraction first literally changes the way we tackle code.
